Realtime Air Quality Monitoring System for smart Infrastructure

The impact of air quality on health and on life comfort is well established. In many societies, vulnerable elderly and young populations spend most of their time indoors. Therefore, Air Quality Monitoring (AQM) is of great importance to human health. This project is end-to-end AQM system enabling measurement of Smoke, Alcohol, CO2 , ambient temperature, and relative humidity. In AQM systems, remote users usually use a local gateway to connect wireless sensor nodes in a given monitoring site to the external world for ubiquitous access of data. In this work, the role of the gateway is processing collected air quality data and its reliable dissemination to end-users through a web-server is emphasized. Gateway also acts as actuator to start ventilation system or air purification devices by using threshold value. The system uses Internet-of-Things (IoT) web-server platform, for live monitoring and long-term storage of the collected AQM data. A modular AQM architecture is adopted, which results in a smart scalable system that allows seamless integration of various sensing technologies, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and smart mobile standards
